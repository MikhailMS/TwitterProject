# Twitter Project
Group project - web service to find twitts on twitter.com
This assignment was proposed as a “real-life” project with a client (students from UoS). 
The aim was to provide a web service with a login system, database and core functionality - search of particular posts in twitter.com, which relate to a fiction company and add the authors of such posts into database, so company can follow them and get a feedback straightaway.
By the end of the assignment team provided fully functional service with advanced feature - we managed to make search of posts and adding their authors automatic - and client accepted it.
